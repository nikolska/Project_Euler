# Names scores
#
# Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand
# first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
# multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
#
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53,
# is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
#
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
